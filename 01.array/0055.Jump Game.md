## Medium Problem: Jump Game
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

**Example 1:**
```java
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**
```java
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what.  
Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
``` 

**Constraints:**
```java
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4  
0 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^5
```

## Solution
### Approach 1: Backtracking  
This is the inefficient solution where we try every single jump pattern  
that takes us from the first position to the last.  
We start from the first position and jump to every index that is reachable.  
We repeat the process until last index is reached. When stuck, backtrack.

#### The Code
```java
class solution{
    public static boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int cur_index = 0;
        return recursion(nums, cur_index);
    }
    
    public static boolean recursion(int[] nums, int cur_index) {
        int step = nums[cur_index];
        if (cur_index + step >= nums.length - 1) {
            return true;
        }
        while (step > 0) {
            if(recursion(nums, cur_index + step)) return true;
            step--;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
