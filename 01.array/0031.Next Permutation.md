## 1. Easy Problem: Next Permutation
Implement **next permutation**, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.  

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).  

The replacement must be **in-place** and use only constant extra memory.  

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

>`1,2,3 → 1,3,2`  
>`3,2,1 → 1,2,3`  
>`1,1,5 → 1,5,1`  

## 2. Solution 

### 2.1. Approach 1: With 4 Single Pass
- The rule is like **Binary Encoding**, such as `10110` is the next permutation of `10101`.  
  - But this "encoding" isnt adding number to last bit to get new permutation.  
  - Its way to get new permutation is by rearranging the existed elements.

- Make sure that if there is no next permutation for current permutation firstly.  

- If `arr[i] >= arr[i+1]` is always true, there is no next permutation.  
  - Therefore, we should reverse the array as request.  
  - Then we can finish the function.

- If `arr[i] < arr[i+1]` is appeared, which proves that the subarray  
    from `arr[i+1]` to `arr[arr.length-1]` has no next permutation.  
  - Then we should find the minimum number which is larger than `arr[i]`  
    in the subarray, record this number as `newStarter`.  
  - Swap the numbers `arr[i]` and `newStarter` which changed the subarray.  
  - Sort the subarray in ascending order.  
  - And the function is finished.

#### 2.1.2. The Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0 || nums.length == 1) return;
        int tail_pointer = nums.length - 2;
        while (tail_pointer >= 0) {
            if (nums[tail_pointer] < nums[tail_pointer + 1]) {
                break;
            }
            tail_pointer--;
        }

        if (tail_pointer == -1) {
            int h_pointer = 0;
            int t_pointer = nums.length - 1;
            int temp;
            while (h_pointer < t_pointer) {
                temp = nums[h_pointer];
                nums[h_pointer] = nums[t_pointer];
                nums[t_pointer] = temp;
                h_pointer++;
                t_pointer--;
            }
        } else {
            int temp;
            for (int i = nums.length - 1; i > tail_pointer; i--) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[tail_pointer]) {
                    temp = nums[i];
                    nums[i] = nums[tail_pointer];
                    nums[tail_pointer] = temp;
                    break;
                }
            }
            int s_pointer = tail_pointer + 1;
            int e_pointer = nums.length - 1;
            while (s_pointer < e_pointer) {
                temp = nums[s_pointer];
                nums[s_pointer] = nums[e_pointer];
                nums[e_pointer] = temp;
                s_pointer++;
                e_pointer--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
