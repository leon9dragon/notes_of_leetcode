## 1. Medium Problem: Majority Element II
Given an integer array of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than `[ n/3 ]` times.  

**Follow-up**: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?  

**Example 1:**  
>**Input**: nums = `[3,2,3]`   
>**Output**: `[3]`

**Example 2:**  
>**Input**: nums = `[1]`  
>**Output**: `[1]`

**Example 3:**  
>**Input**: nums = `[1,2]`  
>**Output**: `[1,2]`  

**Constraints:**
>1 <= `nums.length` <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>   
>-10<sup>9</sup> <= `nums[i]` <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## 2. Solution

### 2.1. Approach 1: Moore Majority Voting Algorithm
0. Firstly, we should know that we can only have maximum 2 majority elements.  
   Here is the process of getting this maximum number:  
   ```
   define C as the probability of the frequent number which is occured
   define X as the count of the appeared frequent number

   According to the request, we can get these:
   C > 1/3
   X*C < 1
   X >= 0

   So here is the result:  
   0 <= X < 3  

   X is integer so the value of X should only be 0/1/2.

   ```

1. We can use Moore majority voting algorithm to get 2 most frequent numbers.  
   The original Moore algorithm can only find the most frequent number.  
   We should add some new parts to it to realize searching 2 frequent numbers.  

2. When we got the frequent numbers may be 0/1/2 number,  
   we should check the if these number appear more than N/3 times.  
   Here is the example:  
   ```
   [1,1,2,2,4,5,6,7,8] here is an array with 9 elements.
   
   The 2 most frequent numbers are 1 and 2, but they appeared only 2 times.

   The N/3 is 3 times, so these 2 numbers cant meet the demand.
   ```

#### 2.1.1. The Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        // We can only have maximum 2 majority elements
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
        Integer major1 = null, major2 = null;

        // step 1. Find out those 2 majority elements
        // Using Moore majority voting algorithm
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (major1 != null && nums[i] == major1) {
                count1++;
            } else if (major2 != null && nums[i] == major2) {
                count2++;
            } else if (count1 == 0) {
                major1 = nums[i];
                count1 = 1;
            } else if (count2 == 0) {
                major2 = nums[i];
                count2 = 1;
            } else {
                count1--;
                count2--;
            }
        }

        // Step 2. Double Check

        //The first round only elects two most frequent numbers as candidates; there is no guarantee that the candidates appear more than N/3 times.
        //Try out this example: [1,1,1,2,3,3] where 1 and 3 are both candidates but only 1 appears more than N/3=2 times.

        count1 = 0;
        count2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (major1 != null && nums[i] == major1) count1++;
            if (major2 != null && nums[i] == major2) count2++;
        }

        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        if (count1 > n / 3) res.add(major1);
        if (count2 > n / 3) res.add(major2);

        return res;
    }
}
```
